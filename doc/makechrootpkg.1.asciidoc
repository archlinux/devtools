Name
----
makechrootpkg - Build a PKGBUILD in a given chroot environment

Synopsis
--------
makechrootpkg [OPTIONS] -r <chrootdir> [--] [makepkg args]

Description
-----------

Run this script in a directory containing a PKGBUILD to build a package
inside a clean chroot. Arguments passed to this script after the
end-of-options marker (--) will be passed to makepkg.

The chroot dir consists of the following directories:
<chrootdir>/{root, copy} but only "root" is required
by default. The working copy will be created as needed

The chroot "root" directory must be created via the following
command:
	mkarchroot <chrootdir>/root base-devel

This script reads {SRC,SRCPKG,PKG,LOG}DEST, MAKEFLAGS and PACKAGER
from makepkg.conf(5), if those variables are not part of the
environment.

Default makepkg args: --syncdeps --noconfirm --log --holdver --skipinteg
