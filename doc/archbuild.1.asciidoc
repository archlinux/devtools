============

Name
----
archbuild - a script to build an Arch Linux package inside a clean chroot. 

Synopsis
--------
archbuild [options] -- [makechrootpkg args]

Description
-----------

'archbuild' is a script to build an Arch Linux package. devtools includes archbuild, but you don't run this command directly. 
It also includes these symlinks:

* kde-unstable-x86_64-build 
* multilib-testing-build 
* testing-x86_64-build
* extra-x86_64-build
* multilib-build 
* gnome-unstable-x86_64-build  
* multilib-staging-build     
* staging-x86_64-build

The symlink used to run it will be inspected by archbuild, to determine which target you want it to use. 


Options
-------

*-h*::
	Output command line options.
  
*-c*::
	Recreate the chroot before building

*-r* <dir>::
	Create chroots in this directory.
