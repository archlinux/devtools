pkgctl-release(1)
=================

Name
----
pkgctl-release - Release step to commit, tag and upload build artifacts

Synopsis
--------
pkgctl release [OPTIONS] [PATH...]

Description
-----------

Modified version controlled files will first be staged for commit,
afterwards a Git tag matching the pkgver will be created and finally
all build artifacts will be uploaded.

By default the target pacman repository will be auto-detected by querying
the repo it is currently released in. When initially adding a new package
to the repositories, the target repo must be specified manually.

Options
-------

*-m, --message* 'MSG'::
	Use the given <msg> as the commit message

*-r, --repo* 'REPO'::
	Specify target repository for new packages not in any official repo.
	Using this option is disallowed if the package is already released, as it
	would circumvent the auto-detection safeguard.

*-s, --staging*::
	Build against the staging counterpart of the auto-detected repo

*-t, --testing*::
	Build against the testing counterpart of the auto-detected repo

*-u, --db-update*::
	Automatically update the pacman database after uploading

*-h, --help*::
	Show a help text
