devtools(7)
===========

Name
----
devtools - Developer tools for the Arch Linux distribution

Description
-----------

Devtools contains tools for package maintenance in Arch Linux. It comes with a
unified command-line frontend called 'pkgctl' that aids to conveniently
interact with all the different tools this collection provides.

The toolset varies from tools for building packages in a clean chroot
('mkarchroot', 'archbuild', ...), packaging related tools ('sogrep', 'diffpkg',
'lddd') and tools for repository management such as ('pkgrepo').
