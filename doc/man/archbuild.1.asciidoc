============

Name
----
archbuild - a script to build an Arch Linux package inside a clean chroot.

Synopsis
--------
archbuild [options] -- [makechrootpkg args]

Description
-----------

'archbuild' is a script to build an Arch Linux package. archbuild is part of devtools but should only be used via one of the included symlinks:

* extra-x86_64-build
* gnome-unstable-x86_64-build
* kde-unstable-x86_64-build
* multilib-build
* multilib-staging-build
* multilib-testing-build
* staging-x86_64-build
* testing-x86_64-build

The symlink used to run it will be inspected by archbuild, to determine which target you want it to use. It will load the available pacman configuration from 'reponame-arch.conf' with a fallback to 'reponame.conf' from {pkgdatadir}/pacman.conf.d. The makepkg configuration is loaded from 'repo-arch.conf' with a fallback to 'reponame.conf' from {pkgdatadir}/makepkg.conf.d.

It will also load the bind mount configuration from 'mount.d/arch' in {pkgdatadir}. The file format is that each line starting with ro and rw will be used, other lines will be ignored, and the rest of the used line is out/path:in/path preceded by a space as a separator. ro means it is a read-only mount, rw means a read-write mount.

Options
-------

*-h*::
	Output command line options.

*-c*::
	Recreate the chroot before building.

*-r* <dir>::
	Create chroots in this directory.
