pkgctl-version-check(1)
=======================

Name
----
pkgctl-version-check - Compares local package versions against upstream

Synopsis
--------
pkgctl version check [OPTIONS] [PKGBASE...]

Description
-----------

Compares the versions of packages in the local packaging repository against
their latest upstream versions.

Upon execution, it generates a grouped list that provides detailed insights
into each package's status. For each package, it displays the current local
version alongside the latest version available upstream.

Outputs a summary of up-to-date packages, out-of-date packages, and any check
failures.

This simplifies the maintenance of PKGBUILD files, reducing the manual effort
required to track version changes from upstream sources.

Configuration
-------------

Uses nvchecker(1) and a `.nvchecker.toml` file located alongside the
PKGBUILD. Refer to the configuration section in pkgctl-version(1).

Options
-------

*-h, --help*::
	Show a help text

Filter Options
--------------

*-v, --verbose*::
	Display all results including up-to-date versions

Output Options
--------------

*--json*::
	Enable printing in JSON; Shorthand for `'--format json'`

*-F, --format* 'FORMAT'::
	Controls the output format of the results; `FORMAT` is `'pretty'`,
	or `'json'` (default `pretty`)

Exit Codes
----------

On exit, return one of the following codes:

*0*::
	Normal exit condition, all checked versions are up-to-date

*1*::
	Unknown cause of failure

*2*::
	Normal exit condition, but there are out-of-date versions
