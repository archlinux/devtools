diffpkg(1)
===========

Name
----
diffpkg - Compare package files using different modes.

Synopsis
--------
diffpkg [OPTIONS] [MODES] [FILE|PKGNAME...]

Description
-----------

Searches for a locally built package corresponding to the PKGBUILD, and
downloads the last version of that package from the Pacman repositories.
It then compares the package archives using different modes while using
simple tar content list by default.

When given one package, use it to diff against the locally built one.
When given two packages, diff both packages against each other.

In either case, a package name will be converted to a filename from the
cache, and diffpkg will proceed as though this filename was initially
specified.
